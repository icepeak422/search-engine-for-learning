 The course presents the concepts of calculus from four points of view: geometric (graphs), numeric (tables), symbolic (formulas), and verbal descriptions. Students will develop their reading, writing, and questioning skills, as well as their ability to work cooperatively. Topics include functions and graphs, derivatives and their applications to real-life problems in various fields, and an introduction to integration. The classroom atmosphere is interactive and cooperative. Both individual and team homework is assigned

The course is a hands-on introduction to various topics in probability. These include basic profitability and combinatorics, conditional probability, expectations, random walks, Poisson distributions and Markov chains. The fundamental, ancient, and deep concepts underlying these  are randomness, fairness, coincidence, and bias. These are all important both in theoretical probability, statistics and real world applications, and the course pursues these ideas from conceptual and applied points of view.

This is an introduction to Fourier Analysis geared towards advanced undergraduate students from both pure and applied areas. It should be particularly suitable for majors in the sciences and engineering. Topics will include properties of complex numbers, the Discrete Fourier Transform, Fourier series, the Dirichlet and Fejer kernals, convolutions, approximations by trigonometric polynomials, uniqueness of Fourier coefficients, Parseval's identity, properties of trigonometric polynomials, absolutely convergent Fourier series, convergence of Fourier series, applications of Fourier series, and the Fourier transform, including the Poisson summation formula and Plancherel's identity.
